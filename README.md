I was kinda bored, so I decided to make a remote control car from scratch.

It uses a DC motor that I mounted onto plywood using Lego.  The drivetrain is made from Lego gears and a differential, which helps with the turning radius of the car. 

I’m using an ESP32 to control everything, and it connects to my phone over Bluetooth (so yeah, I can drive it from anywhere in the room). I used the Serial Bluetooth Terminal app to do this. For power, I built my own battery packs out of alkaline cells, electrical tape, and tinfoil—definitely sketchy, but it works.

The steering is via a servo attached to a gear, and I built custom suspension for the front.  

The chassis is 3d printed, and I decided to make it look like a DeLorean because, well, why not?

In this video, I go through how I built the battery, wired the circuit, designed the chassis, and figured out the steering and suspension. Check it out if you want to learn more + see the end product :)
